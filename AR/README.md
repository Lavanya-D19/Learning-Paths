# 🎉 Welcome to vRuby AR Learning

Welcome to the **AR Learning Path**! This guide helps you explore **Augmented Reality** quickly and confidently.  
By the end of this track, you’ll be ready to design and build interactive AR experiences.

---

## 💡 Why This Matters
Augmented Reality is transforming industries — from **retail and healthcare** to **education and training**.  
Learning AR helps you build products that merge the digital and physical world.  

:::tip
Focus on one AR tool (Unity + Vuforia or AR Foundation) before exploring multiple platforms.

## 🚀 Getting Started
1. Read the **AR Basics** (what is AR, real-world use cases).  
2. Install **Unity** + **Vuforia** (or AR Foundation).  
3. Set up your first **AR Image Target project**.  
4. Deploy and test AR on a mobile device.  

:::note
Don’t skip the setup steps — AR projects rely heavily on proper installation.
