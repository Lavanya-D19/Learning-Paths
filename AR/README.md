# AR Learning Path

Welcome to the **AR (Augmented Reality) Learning Path** 🚀  
This guide will introduce you to AR tools, workflows, and projects.  
By the end of this path, you’ll be able to build and demo your own AR mini-projects using Unity and AR SDKs.

---

## 📌 Introduction
Augmented Reality (AR) blends the digital and physical worlds by overlaying 3D content, animations, and information on top of the real environment.  
At Veeruby, AR is used to create interactive business solutions, immersive training modules, and engaging learning experiences.  

*(TODO: Add Veeruby-specific AR vision + examples later)*

## 🛠️ Tools & Setup
To start building AR apps, install and configure these tools:  

- **Unity Hub + Unity LTS** (recommended: 2022.3.x LTS)  
- **Vuforia Engine** or **AR Foundation Package** (depending on project type)  
- **Mobile Device Setup** (Android / iOS with ARCore or ARKit support)  

*(TODO: Add step-by-step setup screenshots in `/assets`)*

## 📂 Projects & Assignments
You’ll apply your learning by completing small AR projects:  

1. **Hello AR** → Display a 3D object on an image marker.  
2. **AR Business Card** → Add interactive buttons (LinkedIn, Email, Call) on a scanned business card.  
3. **AR Demo Project** → Create a small AR scene relevant to your chosen domain (education, marketing, etc.).  

*(TODO: Add Veeruby AR project templates here)*
