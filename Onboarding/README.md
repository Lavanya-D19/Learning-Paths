## ✉️ Email Guidelines
- Use a **professional tone** and your real name.  
- Use **official purposes only**; keep communications on record.  
- Include a clear subject (e.g., `[Project] Daily Update – 2025-09-08`).  
- Avoid sharing sensitive credentials or tokens over email—use approved channels.

> **NOTE:** Email is for formal communication only. Use Discord for day-to-day chats.

---

## 💬 Communication Guidelines (Discord)
- **Primary tool**: Discord.
- **Channels**:
  - `#announcements` — company-wide updates
  - `#introductions` — post your intro in Week 1
  - `#help` — ask for help early; include screenshots/logs
  - `<project-channel>` — daily async updates
- **Etiquette**:
  - Prefer threads over DMs for project decisions.
  - Share blockers early and tag your lead if urgent.
  - Default timezone: **IST (UTC+5:30)**; expected reply within 4 working hours.

> **NOTE:** If you are stuck, post in `#help` — don’t wait silently.

---

## 📂 Project Access & Workflow Basics
- **Branching**: `main` (protected), use `feat/*`, `fix/*`, `chore/*`.
- **Commits**: follow **Conventional Commits** (feat, fix, docs, chore…).
- **PR checklist**:
  - Clear title & description
  - Screenshots for UI changes
  - Self-review (no debug logs, no secrets)
  - Request a reviewer

> **NOTE:** Never push directly to `main`.
