  - Clear title & description
  - Screenshots for UI changes

## ⏳ Task Prioritization Guide

Managing your tasks well is just as important as completing them.  
Use this guide to decide what to work on first and how to stay on track.

### 🔑 Priority Levels
- **High (🚨 Critical)** → Deadline within 1–2 days, or a blocker for the team.  
- **Medium (⚡ Important)** → Contributes to weekly goals, but not urgent.  
- **Low (🌱 Nice-to-have)** → Long-term or optional improvements.  

### 🗂️ How to Prioritize
1. **Check deadlines first** → Always deliver on time.  
2. **Identify dependencies** → If your task blocks others, finish it first.  
3. **Follow the 80/20 rule** → Focus on tasks that give the most impact.  
4. **Communicate early** → If blocked, raise it in your **Onboarding Checklist Issue**.  

### ✅ Daily Flow
- Start day by reviewing **High-priority tasks**.  
- Allocate ~70% of your time to high/medium, ~30% to learning & improvements.  
- Update your progress in the **Weekly Progress Form**.  

### 📌 Example
- 🚨 **Submit Weekly Progress Form (Friday 5 PM)** → High  
- ⚡ **Research AR tutorial links (due in 3 days)** → Medium  
- 🌱 **Polish README formatting** → Low  

💡 *Tip: Always finish High before Medium, Medium before Low.*
