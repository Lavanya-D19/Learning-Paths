# Documentation Standards

To keep all learning paths consistent, follow these standards when adding or updating content.

## üìÇ Folder & File Structure
- Store assets (images, diagrams, videos) in `/assets`.
- Use `.md` files for all content inside respective path folders (Onboarding, AR, VR, AI).

## üìç Source of Truth
This is the official **Documentation Standards** guide. Always refer here for the latest updates.

- This guide lives in the `/docs/` folder of our GitHub repo.  
- The single source of truth is this file: **Documentation_Standards.md**.  
- Admin update rules are documented in [`ADMIN_Update_Process.md`](./admin/ADMIN_Update_Process.md).  
- All update activity must be logged in [`ADMIN_Update_Log.md`](./admin/ADMIN_Update_Log.md).  

> **NOTE:** Always check this file first ‚Äî it is the latest and only master copy for documentation rules.

## üñºÔ∏è Images, Links, Headings & TODO
- Place all images in `/assets`.
- Reference them in `.md` using:
  ```markdown
  ![Alt text](/assets/filename.png)
- Use descriptive links:  
  [GitHub Getting Started Guide](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started)

- Use headings consistently:  
  `#` for file title  
  `##` for sections  
  `###` for subsections  

- Mark incomplete content with `(TODO: ...)`.
