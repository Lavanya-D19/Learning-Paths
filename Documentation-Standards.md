# Documentation Standards

To keep all learning paths consistent, follow these standards when adding or updating content.

---

## 📂 Folder & File Structure
- Store assets (images, diagrams, videos) in `/assets`.
- Use `.md` files for all content inside respective path folders (Onboarding, AR, VR, AI).

---

## 🖼️ Images, Links, Headings & TODO
- Place all images in `/assets`.
- Reference them in `.md` using:
  ```markdown
  ![Alt text](/assets/filename.png)
- Use descriptive links:  
  [GitHub Getting Started Guide](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started)

- Use headings consistently:  
  `#` for file title  
  `##` for sections  
  `###` for subsections  

- Mark incomplete content with `(TODO: ...)`.
