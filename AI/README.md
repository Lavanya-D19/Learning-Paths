# AI / Machine Learning Learning Path

Welcome to the AI/ML Path. This track transforms you from beginner to advanced ML practitioner in 12 weeks. By the end, youâ€™ll build and deploy real ML models and understand how AI is applied in business.

## What youâ€™ll learn
- Python and Jupyter basics
- Core machine learning concepts
- Building, evaluating, and deploying ML models
- AI ethics and real-world applications

## Beginner (Weeks 1â€“2)
**Learning outcome:** Get comfortable with Python & ML basics.

### Topics covered
- Python setup & Jupyter Notebooks
- Intro to Machine Learning concepts
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### Mini task
Train a simple linear regression model (e.g., predict house prices).

### Resources
- [Learn Python](https://www.learnpython.org/)
- [Google ML Crash Course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course)

## Intermediate (Weeks 3â€“6)
**Learning outcome:** Build small ML applications & deploy them.

### Topics covered
- Data cleaning & feature engineering
- Classification & Regression models
- Model evaluation (accuracy, precision, recall)
- Serving ML models via APIs

### Project
Build a classification model (e.g., spam vs. not-spam) and deploy it with FastAPI.

### Resources
- [Scikit-Learn Documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [FastAPI Docs](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)

## Advanced (Weeks 7â€“12)
**Learning outcome:** Learn to scale ML and explore AI ethics.

### Topics covered
- Model monitoring & optimization
- Handling edge cases (imbalanced data, overfitting)
- AI ethics, fairness & bias

### Capstone project
End-to-end ML pipeline â†’ data â†’ training â†’ serving â†’ monitoring.

### Resources
- [AI Fairness Resources](https://ai.google/responsibilities/responsible-ai-resources/)
