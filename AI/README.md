# AI Learning Path

Welcome to the **AI Learning Path** 🤖  
This guide will introduce you to AI fundamentals, tools, and applications.  
By the end of this path, you’ll be able to experiment with machine learning models and build simple AI-powered applications.

## 📌 Introduction
Artificial Intelligence (AI) enables machines to perform tasks that usually require human intelligence — such as understanding language, recognizing images, or making predictions.  
At Veeruby, AI is integrated into AR/VR experiences for intelligent interactions, data analysis, and adaptive learning.  

*(TODO: Add Veeruby-specific AI vision + project examples later)*

## 🛠️ Tools & Setup
To get started with AI development, install and configure:  

- **Python 3.10+** (programming language for AI/ML)  
- **Jupyter Notebook** (interactive coding environment)  
- **OpenAI API / Hugging Face Transformers** (for LLMs, NLP, and generative AI)  
- **Optional:** Google Colab (cloud-based notebook environment, no setup required)  

*(TODO: Add screenshots of installation and API key setup in `/assets`)*

## 📂 Projects & Assignments
Practice your skills with beginner-friendly projects:  

1. **Hello AI** → Run a simple “text generation” script using OpenAI API.  
2. **Sentiment Analysis App** → Build a notebook that classifies text as Positive/Negative.  
3. **Mini AI Demo** → Use Hugging Face to load a pre-trained model (e.g., for Q&A or summarization).  

*(TODO: Add Veeruby-specific AI mini-projects later, like AI-powered AR/VR use cases)*
