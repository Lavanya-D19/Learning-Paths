## 🎯 Beginner (Weeks 1–2)
**Learning Outcome:** Get comfortable with Python & ML basics.  

📌 **Topics Covered:**  
- ✅ Python setup & Jupyter Notebooks  
- ✅ Intro to Machine Learning concepts  
- ✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  

🛠️ **Mini Task:** Train a simple linear regression model (e.g., predict house prices).  

📚 **Resources:**  
- [Learn Python](https://www.learnpython.org/)  
- [Google ML Crash Course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course)

## 🚀 Intermediate (Weeks 3–6)
**Learning Outcome:** Build small ML applications & deploy them.  

📌 **Topics Covered:**  
- ✅ Data cleaning & feature engineering  
- ✅ Classification & Regression models  
- ✅ Model evaluation (accuracy, precision, recall)  
- ✅ Serving ML models via APIs  

🛠️ **Project:** Build a classification model (e.g., spam vs. not-spam) and deploy it with FastAPI.  

📚 **Resources:**  
- [Scikit-Learn Documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)  
- [FastAPI Docs](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)

## 🏆 Advanced (Weeks 7–12)
**Learning Outcome:** Learn to scale ML and explore AI ethics.  

📌 **Topics Covered:**  
- ✅ Model monitoring & optimization  
- ✅ Handling edge cases (imbalanced data, overfitting)  
- ✅ AI ethics, fairness & bias  

🛠️ **Capstone Project:** End-to-end ML pipeline → data → training → serving → monitoring.  

📚 **Resources:**  
- [TensorFlow Tutorials](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials)  
- [Responsible AI Principles](https://ai.google/responsibilities/responsible-ai-practices/)
