# 🤖 AI / Machine Learning Learning Path

Welcome to the **AI/ML track** at vRuby!  
Across ~12 weeks you’ll learn Python, ML fundamentals, model training, and deployment — with a focus on **hands-on projects** and **responsible AI**.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start (Week 0–1)

1. Install Python 3.11+ and set up a virtual environment.  
2. Finish the **Python refresher** below.  
3. Skim the **ML Crash Course** and take notes.  
4. Join the **#ai-ml** Discord channel.

:::tip Pro tip
Stay consistent: 60–90 minutes **daily** beats weekend marathons.

## ✅ Checklist Overview

- ✅ Python set up and basics revised  
- ✅ First ML model trained (scikit-learn)  
- ✅ Model evaluated (accuracy, precision/recall, confusion matrix)  
- ✅ Basic API built with FastAPI to serve predictions  
- ✅ Read **Responsible AI** primer and add mitigations to project  

---

## 🧭 Next Steps

- Start with **[Learn Python](https://www.learnpython.org/)** if you’re new.  
- Complete **[Google ML Crash Course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course)**.  
- Build a simple model in **scikit-learn** (e.g., Iris or Titanic).  
- Wrap it with **[FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)** and expose `/predict`.  
- Read **[AI Fairness](https://ai.google/responsibilities/responsible-ai-resources/)** and add one mitigation (balanced dataset, threshold tuning).  
- When ready, explore **[AR Path](../AR/README.md)** or **[VR Path](../VR/README.md)**.
