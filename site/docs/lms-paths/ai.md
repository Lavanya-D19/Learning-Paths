# ü§ñ AI/ML Learning Path

Welcome to the **AI/ML Path**!  
This 12-week track introduces Python programming, machine learning workflows, and integrating AI into XR applications. You‚Äôll build projects from small experiments to a final showcase.

---

## üéØ Learning Objectives
By completing this path, you will:
- Learn **Python basics** and core ML concepts.  
- Understand **datasets, preprocessing, and model training**.  
- Use libraries like **TensorFlow/PyTorch** for ML workflows.  
- Apply AI in **AR/VR projects** (chatbots, recognition, analytics).  
- Deliver a **portfolio-ready AI project**.
