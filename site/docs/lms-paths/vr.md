# 🥽 Virtual Reality (VR) Learning Path

Welcome to the **VR Learning Path**!  
This 12-week track guides you through building immersive VR applications with Unity and XR plugins. You’ll start with setup, move into interactive projects, and finish with a polished VR experience.

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
By completing this path, you will:
- Understand **VR concepts, safety, and user comfort**.  
- Set up **Unity XR Plugin, OpenXR, and Oculus tools**.  
- Build interactive VR scenes with **locomotion, grabbing, teleporting, and UI**.  
- Optimize VR performance and design for comfort.  
- Deliver a final **multiplayer or simulation VR project**.

## 📅 12-Week VR Path Structure

| Phase            | Weeks  | Focus Area                  | Example Milestone             |
|------------------|--------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Beginner**     | 1–2    | VR basics & Unity XR setup  | Load a VR scene with locomotion |
| **Intermediate** | 3–6    | Interactions & UI/UX        | Create a VR mini-game         |
| **Advanced**     | 7–12   | Multiplayer & optimization  | Final VR multiplayer demo     |
