# 🚀 Augmented Reality (AR) Learning Path

Welcome to the **AR Learning Path**!  
This 12-week program takes you from setup to publishing a working AR demo. You’ll begin with foundations, build guided projects, and finish with an independent showcase.

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
By completing this path, you will:
- Understand the **principles of AR** and its real-world use cases.  
- Set up **Unity, AR Foundation, and Vuforia** for AR development.  
- Build apps with **image targets, plane detection, and AR interactions**.  
- Optimize AR apps for **mobile devices**.  
- Showcase a final **portfolio-ready AR demo project**.

## 📅 12-Week AR Path Structure

| Phase            | Weeks  | Focus Area                        | Example Milestone                  |
|------------------|--------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **Beginner**     | 1–4    | Setup, Unity basics, AR concepts  | First ImageTarget AR demo          |
| **Intermediate** | 5–8    | Guided AR projects, UI/UX design  | Submit AR Product Viewer demo      |
| **Advanced**     | 9–12   | Independent AR project            | Deliver final AR showcase project  |
