## ✉️ Email Guidelines
- Use a **professional tone** and your real name.  
- Use **official purposes only**; keep communications on record.  
- Include a clear subject (e.g., `[Project] Daily Update – 2025-09-08`).  
- Avoid sharing sensitive credentials or tokens over email—use approved channels.

> **NOTE:** Email is for formal communication only. Use Discord for day-to-day chats.

---

## 💬 Communication Guidelines (Discord)
- **Primary tool**: Discord.
- **Channels**:
  - `#announcements` — company-wide updates
  - `#introductions` — post your intro in Week 1
  - `#help` — ask for help early; include screenshots/logs
  - `<project-channel>` — daily async updates
- **Etiquette**:
  - Prefer threads over DMs for project decisions.
  - Share blockers early and tag your lead if urgent.
  - Default timezone: **IST (UTC+5:30)**; expected reply within 4 working hours.

> **NOTE:** If you are stuck, post in `#help` — don’t wait silently.

---

## 📂 Project Access & Workflow Basics
- **Branching**: `main` (protected), use `feat/*`, `fix/*`, `chore/*`.
- **Commits**: follow **Conventional Commits** (feat, fix, docs, chore…).
- **PR checklist**:
  - Clear title & description
  - Screenshots for UI changes
  - Self-review (no debug logs, no secrets)
  - Request a reviewer

> **NOTE:** Never push directly to `main`.

## ⏳ Task Prioritization Guide

Managing your tasks well is just as important as completing them.  
Use this guide to decide what to work on first and how to stay on track.

### 🔑 Priority Levels
- **High (🚨 Critical)** → Deadline within 1–2 days, or a blocker for the team.  
- **Medium (⚡ Important)** → Contributes to weekly goals, but not urgent.  
- **Low (🌱 Nice-to-have)** → Long-term or optional improvements.  

### 🗂️ How to Prioritize
1. **Check deadlines first** → Always deliver on time.  
2. **Identify dependencies** → If your task blocks others, finish it first.  
3. **Follow the 80/20 rule** → Focus on tasks that give the most impact.  
4. **Communicate early** → If blocked, raise it in your **Onboarding Checklist Issue**.  

### ✅ Daily Flow
- Start day by reviewing **High-priority tasks**.  
- Allocate ~70% of your time to high/medium, ~30% to learning & improvements.  
- Update your progress in the **Weekly Progress Form**.  

### 📌 Example
- 🚨 **Submit Weekly Progress Form (Friday 5 PM)** → High  
- ⚡ **Research AR tutorial links (due in 3 days)** → Medium  
- 🌱 **Polish README formatting** → Low  

💡 *Tip: Always finish High before Medium, Medium before Low.*
