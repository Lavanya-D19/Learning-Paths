# ðŸ”„ Migration Log

This log records **major migrations or structural changes** in the vRuby LMS.  
It is separate from the [Admin Update Log](admin-update-log.md), focusing only on **system-wide moves, reorganizations, or framework changes**.

- Describe **why** and **what changed**.  
- Keep entries concise, one bullet per change.  
- Only log **structural or system-level** changes, not content edits.

## âœ… Outcomes
This log provides:
- A clear history of **repo and site migrations**.
