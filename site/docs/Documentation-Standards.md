# Documentation Standards (v1.0)

This repo is the **single source of truth** for onboarding and learning. Follow these standards so docs stay clear and consistent.

---

## 1) File & Folder Conventions
- Use `Title_Case_With_Underscores.md` for admin docs; keep `README.md` in each folder.
- Store images in `/assets/`.
- Prefer **relative links** so links keep working after renames.

**Examples**
- `Onboarding/README.md`
- `ADMIN_Update_Process.md`
- `assets/form-quiz-preview.png`

---

## 2) Headings, Spacing, Lists
- Start files with a `#` H1.
- Leave **one blank line** above and below headings and lists.
- Keep paragraphs short (≈ 3–4 lines).

```md
