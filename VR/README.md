# 🎉 Welcome to vRuby VR Learning

Welcome to the **VR Learning Path**! This guide helps you dive into **Virtual Reality** and create immersive 3D worlds.  
By the end of this track, you’ll be ready to design, build, and showcase VR projects.

---

## 💡 Why This Matters
Virtual Reality is reshaping **training, gaming, design, and healthcare**.  
By learning VR, you gain the ability to create experiences that feel truly immersive.  

:::tip
Always test your VR projects with an actual headset to catch issues early.

## 🚀 Getting Started
1. Learn the **basics of VR** (devices, interactions, use cases).  
2. Install **Unity** + **XR Interaction Toolkit**.  
3. Create your first **VR scene** with teleportation & interaction.  
4. Test with a VR headset (Oculus, HTC Vive, etc.).  

:::note
Even if you don’t have a headset, you can simulate VR in Unity’s play mode.
