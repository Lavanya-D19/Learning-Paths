# VR Learning Path

Welcome to the **VR (Virtual Reality) Learning Path** 🎮  
This guide will introduce you to VR tools, workflows, and projects.  
By the end of this path, you’ll be able to design and build immersive VR demos using Unity and the XR Interaction Toolkit.

## 📌 Introduction
Virtual Reality (VR) creates fully immersive digital environments where users can interact using headsets and controllers.  
At Veeruby, VR is applied in training simulations, interactive learning, gaming, and enterprise solutions for industries like healthcare and education.

## 🛠️ Tools & Setup
To begin VR development, you’ll need:  

- **Unity Hub + Unity LTS** (recommended: 2022.3.x LTS)  
- **XR Interaction Toolkit** (for VR interactions like grab, teleport, UI)  
- **VR Headset Setup** (Meta Quest, HTC Vive, Pico, or similar)  
- **Optional:** SteamVR or OpenXR depending on your device  

*(TODO: Add step-by-step setup screenshots in `/assets`)*

## 📂 Projects & Assignments
You’ll practice VR workflows by building small projects:  

1. **Hello VR** → Create a basic VR scene with teleportation.  
2. **VR Interaction Demo** → Add grabbable objects and interactive buttons.  
3. **Mini VR Experience** → Build a themed demo (education, training, or entertainment).  

*(TODO: Add Veeruby VR templates or project briefs here)*
